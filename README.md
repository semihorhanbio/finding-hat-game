In this project, I’ll be building an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

You can test and run your code with the command ```node main.js``` in terminal.

Watch this video to get a sense of what I’ll be building:
